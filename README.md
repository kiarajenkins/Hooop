# Hooop!
A digital recreation of the board game "Hooop!" made in Java, utilizing OOP and Java Swing for core gameplay and GUI elements. The game board is a pond with lily pads, connected by bridges. The players are frogs who each have a home lily pad, and the goal is to get your frogs across to the opponent home bases. Each player also has 4 special action cards. Supports 2 players or 4 players, includes save & load functionality, and accommodates colour vision deficiency through numbers on each frog.

## 🌺 Game Rules
1. Each player has 3 frogs and 4 one-time use action cards "Parachute", "Extra Jump", "Extra Bridge", and "Bridge Removal".
2. Jump your frogs across lily pads to reach your opponents' home base.
3. Jumping removes the bridge you used.
4. Instead of moving, you may place a new bridge, or use one of your special action cards.
5. Landing on another frog pushes it to another connected lily pad.
6. In 4 player mode, get a frog to each of your opponents' home bases to win.
7. In 2 player mode, get all your frogs on your opponents home base to win.
